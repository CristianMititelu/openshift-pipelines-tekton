# OpenShift Pipelines - Porting a Jenkins Pipeline to a Tekton Pipeline

[OpenShift Pipelines](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/pipelines) is a framework for creating cloud-native CI/CD pipelines in a Kubernetes environemnt.  OpenShift Pipelines is based on the upstream [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) project that is part of the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation/). 

As of today's Demo, OpenShift Pipelines is now in *Tech Preview*.

For this demo, we will take the Jenkins pipeline that we used in a previous demo and re-create it using OpenShift Pipelines!
